# codeigniter_secure_authentication
This is a base project for authentticating users securely. It hashes passwords with random tokens and checks expiration with the database.
It uses Kenji's amazing composer package that implements all security measures for our installation automatically. So a huge thanks to Kenji for saving me a lot of work :)

When this project is finished I will add a SQL file you can use so you can use this project without much difficulty
