# codeigniter_secure_authentication
This is a base project for authentticating users securely. It hashes passwords with random tokens and checks expiration with the database. A two way crypting algoritm is used for obfustcating id's before communicating with external API's that uses rotating salts.

The entire project is built to be used with PSR-4 and composer. As of now this is still a private project but might be made into a public project in the future.
