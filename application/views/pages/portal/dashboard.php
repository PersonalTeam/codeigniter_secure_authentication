        <p>This is truly an almighty mountain. You can get away with a lot. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>
        <p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>
